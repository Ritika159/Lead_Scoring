# Lead_Scoring

📋 Project Overview

X Education, an online education company, aims to improve its lead conversion process by focusing on potential leads (referred to as "Hot Leads"). Currently, the conversion rate is approximately 30%, and the company seeks a data-driven approach to identify high-potential leads more efficiently.

This project involves building a Logistic Regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. The score helps prioritize leads for the sales team, improving conversion rates by focusing on the most promising prospects.

🎯 Problem Statement
The company generates leads through multiple channels:
- Website visits
- Form submissions
- Video engagement
- Referrals from past customers
Leads are contacted by the sales team via emails and phone calls. However, due to a high volume of leads, a significant amount of time and effort is wasted on cold leads that are unlikely to convert. The company wants to identify hot leads to optimize the sales process and improve the overall efficiency of their team.

🔍 Objectives
1. Develop a Logistic Regression model to:
- Predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer.
- Assign a lead score (0–100) for prioritization.

2. Ensure the model is:
- Flexible to accommodate future changes in the company's requirements.
- Scalable to handle varying volumes of leads.

3. Provide actionable insights for the sales team to focus efforts on hot leads, thereby improving the lead conversion rate.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Python: For data processing, analysis, and model development.
- Pandas, NumPy: Data wrangling and preparation.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizing data and relationships.
- Scikit-learn: Logistic regression modeling, evaluation metrics, and feature engineering.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for analysis and experimentation.

📊 Methodology
1. Data Understanding and Cleaning:
- Analyze the dataset for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Handle missing data and preprocess features to prepare for modeling.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Understand the relationship between features and lead conversion.
- Identify significant patterns and correlations.

3. Feature Engineering:
- Create new features based on domain knowledge.
- Scale numerical features and encode categorical variables.

4. Model Development:
- Build a Logistic Regression model to predict lead conversion probability.
- Assign scores based on predicted probabilities.

5. Model Evaluation:
- Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model performance.
- Optimize thresholds to balance between precision and recall.

6. Insights and Recommendations:
- Provide actionable recommendations for the sales team based on lead scores.
- Highlight high-impact features influencing lead conversion.

🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ritika159/lead_scoring.git

2. Run the notebook:
jupyter notebook lead_scoring.ipynb

3. Input the dataset (leads_data.csv), preprocess it, and train the model to generate lead scores.

✨ Key Insights
1. High-Priority Features:
- Leads from specific referral sources tend to convert more frequently.
- Engaged leads (form submissions or video views) show higher conversion potential.

2. Optimized Threshold:
- The ideal threshold for lead scoring balances precision (reducing wasted effort) and recall (capturing hot leads).

3. Actionable Segmentation:
- Leads with scores above 80 are most likely to convert and should be prioritized.

📈 Future Enhancements
- Incorporate more advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for better performance.
- Automate the lead scoring process for real-time updates.
- Build a dashboard to visualize lead scores and conversion predictions.
